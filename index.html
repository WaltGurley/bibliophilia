          <span class="cod-style cod-color">College of Design, 2017.</span> Currently library holdings searches in web browsers return titles and general descriptions but little to suggest the spirit and design of books. In the summer of 2018 the N.C. State Libraries are moving many of the books currently located in D.H. Hill Library’s oversize section into the bookBot inventory of Hunt Library, making it no longer possible to freely browse through them for material and visual characteristics. Before this happened, an alphabet of <i>Graphic Design</i> (GD) sophomores, with four to spare, got one last browsing adventure in that glorious oversize section, which is an A-to-Z microcosm of the library’s holdings, a selection of all books too large to fit in the regular stacks, many bigger than this sentence is long. Thirty (30) students bring 71 (seventy-one) books to life in ninety (90) animated gifs. This is a celebration of browsing the shelves of a library. <span class="url-for-immersion cod-style">go.ncsu.edu/bibliophilia</span>
